# PrintingService
Suppose that the cost of printing large photos (24 x 36) is calculated as follows:
- Service charge $3.00 
- $7.99 per copy for the first 10 copies 
- $7.25 for each addition copy  
- Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of copies to print, then calculates and prints the amount due.
